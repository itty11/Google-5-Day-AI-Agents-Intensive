## Problem Statement

Modern enterprises face growing demands for scalable, accurate customer support to handle product queries related to pricing, inventory, and technical specs. Relying solely on traditional support channels often results in slow responses and knowledge silos—reducing customer satisfaction and business agility.

## Why Agents?

Agents automate routine queries, persist conversation history, and provide personalized service on demand. They’re ideal for scaling support, enabling collaboration, and delivering high-quality answers instantly. Multi-agent systems improve both operational efficiency and customer experience through modular, resilient, and context-aware workflows.

## What I Created

The project is a modular multi-agent platform built with Google ADK and Gemini LLMs. It features a product catalog agent, session tools for personalized support, and an interactive UI for real-time demonstration. It supports multi-turn, context-rich conversations and seamless agent orchestration.

## Demo

A simple notebook and ipywidgets interface lets users query product details, prices, and availability live. Agents respond instantly, support correction flows, and personalize replies based on user info and session data.

## The Build

- **Frameworks:** Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini LLM.
- **Tools:** Custom Python functions and ADK FunctionTools.
- **UI:** Built with ipywidgets for interactive product queries.
- **Session & Memory:** Ephemeral, in-memory management for fast prototyping.
- **Evaluation:** Response scoring and logging.

## If I Had More Time

- Integrate real-time APIs for dynamic product catalogs.
- Deploy as a public web service using Google Cloud Run or Vertex AI.
- Enhance analytics for accuracy, usage, and user sentiment.
- Build knowledge feedback loops to improve agent learning.
- Extend agents to cover additional enterprise domains (returns, support tickets, recommendations).
